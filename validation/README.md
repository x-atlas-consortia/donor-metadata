# Validation scripts
April 2025 

## Scope
This folder contains scripts that were developed to address 
one-time issues related to formatting of donor metadata, including:

1. changes in donor race and sex that require updates to titles for DOIs of published datasets
2. accomodating variable formats for numeric data (integer and decimal)

The donor-metadata application is intended primarily as a means to edit the metadata of 
one donor at a time, and is not suitable for bulk validation.
